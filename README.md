## Problems
* Transparency - Currently there is no verification of each individual's vote count;also keeping track of fake votes is difficult
* Budget - A standard EVM cost is quite high,also other machinery and infrasturcture costs make it a costly affair
* Geographical Issues - For voters from isolated regions, voting is a hassle for both the Election Commission and the voters themselves.This adds to the cost of conducting elections.Also the traditional system restricts the voters to be present in their constituency
* Security - EVM hacking; Poll both influence; Duplicate voter identities; Impersonation;
* First-past-the-post voting system - Tactical Voting, Wasted votes, Gerrymandering, Smaller parties may reduce the success of the largest similar party.
* Only one voting attempt - irrespective of the reason, voters presently have only one attempt to make a vote.

## Idea
* Instant-runoff voting system execution is difficult when done through EVMs. But by using blockchain technologies this can be implemented quickly and more efficiently.In this voting system participants will give an order of preference for the candidates and this will prevent vote cutting 
* Display of live results. Enabling voters to change their votes any number of times. Every vote can be processed as a transaction. Hence with history of votes, the latest transaction, at the time of the deadline, can be used as the final vote.Some people tend to vote on winning ability of candidates and would like to change their votes after the results.Our feature solves this problem
* Live vote Display. Vote count display along with live fake votes detected/destroyed display.
* SMS integrated voting to increase reach where people won't have access to the App/Internet.

## The App
* Voter ID : Each voter will register on our App with the Voter ID number and Aadhar number.New voters will be allowed to apply for Voter ID through Aadhar Card.This will curb malpractices existing in the current system
* Voting Process : The voters can give a preference of the candidates rather than choosing one necessarily.Each individual can change his vote fduring the entire duration of the elections and can see live vote count(results)
 SMS Integration for people with no access to App/Internet.They will vote via SMS and recieve all the live updates through SMS periodically 
 
 ## How are we using Blockchain ?
 
* Information is stored across network of computers and is more secure because transactions are agreed and approved before they are recorded.This eliminates fake votes
 * Low cost and IMproved efficeincy and speed.Benefits everyone involved
 * Data on a Blockchain is more secure,accurate and consistent which reduces unfair means in traditional methods.Transaction    histories are available and there is increased transparency.Verification of each process and live display of information(multpile attempt voting,vote count,results etc)
